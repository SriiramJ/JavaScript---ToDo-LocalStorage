# JavaScript---ToDo- Using LocalStorage



```markdown
# To-Do List Web App

A fully functional **To-Do List** web application built using `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`, utilizing **local storage** to save tasks persistently.  

## Features

- Add tasks with ease.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Delete individual tasks.
- Clear all tasks with a single click.
- Persistent task storage using local storage (data remains even after closing the browser).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

A modern web browser to run the application.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sriramj/todo-list.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash
   cd JavaScript---ToDo-LocalStorage
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser to use the app.

## Project Structure

```
ðŸ“¦todo-list
 â”£ ðŸ“œindex.html     # Main HTML file
 â”£ ðŸ“œstyle.css      # Styling for the app
 â”£ ðŸ“œscript.js      # JavaScript logic
 â”— ðŸ“œREADME.md      # Project documentation
```

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing functionality and interacting with local storage.

## How It Works

1. Tasks are dynamically added to the list using JavaScript.
2. Local storage is used to store tasks, ensuring they persist between browser sessions.
3. Users can mark tasks as completed, delete specific tasks, or clear the entire list.
